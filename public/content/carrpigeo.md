# Carrpigeo

Carrpigeo is a lightweight email sending API built with Go. It sends emails via SMTP and stores every sent message in a PostgreSQL database.

## Prerequisites

- [Go](https://go.dev/dl/) 1.26+
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) 17+ (local install **or** Docker)
- [Docker & Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) (optional — for containerized setup)
- SMTP credentials (e.g. Gmail [App Password](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833))

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dmi3midd/carrpigeo.git
cd carrpigeo
```

### 2. Run the setup script

This creates the `storage/` directory, copies `config.example.yaml` → `config.yaml`, and creates the log file:

```bash
make setup
```

### 3. Configure

Edit `config.yaml` with your credentials:

```yaml
# Configure it for you.
database:
  name: carrpigeo
  host: postgres
  port: 5432
  user: carrpigeo_user
  password: carrpigeo_9876
  sslmode: disable
  maxOpenConns: 10
  maxIdleConns: 10
  maxIdleTime: 15m

httpServer:
  address: 0.0.0.0:2500

smtp:
  host: smtp.gmail.com
  port: 587
  user: your-email@gmail.com
  password: your-app-password

log:
  logPath: ./storage/carrpigeo.log
```

> **Note:** For Gmail, you need to generate an [App Password](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833) — regular account passwords won't work with SMTP.

## Running the Project

### Option A: Local (without Docker)

> **Note** Make sure PostgreSQL is running locally and the database exist.

Run:

```bash
make run
```

Or use `air` for auto-reloading:

```bash
make watch
```

The server starts on `http://localhost:2500`.

### Option B: Docker — app + PostgreSQL (Recommended if you don't have PostgreSQL DB)

Set `host: postgres` in `config.yaml`, then:

```bash
make docker-run-all
```

This spins up both the app and a PostgreSQL container. Migrations run automatically on startup.

### Option C: Docker — app only (external PostgreSQL)

If PostgreSQL is already running on your machine, set `host: host.docker.internal` in `config.yaml`, then:

```bash
make docker-run
```

This starts only the app container; it connects to your host's PostgreSQL.

## API Endpoints

### `GET /health`

Returns database health status.

**Response:** `200 OK`

```json
{
    "idle": "1",
    "in_use": "0",
    "max_idle_closed": "0",
    "max_lifetime_closed": "0",
    "message": "It's healthy",
    "open_connections": "1",
    "status": "up",
    "wait_count": "0",
    "wait_duration": "0s"
}
```

---

### `POST /send/email`

Sends an email and saves it to the database.

**Request body:**

```json
{
  "to": "recipient@example.com",
  "subject": "Hello",
  "body": "This is the email body"
}
```

**Response:** `202 Accepted`

**Error responses:**

| Code | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 400  | Invalid request body |
| 500  | Failed to send email or save to database |
